//After hanging his painting on the wall, Derek realizes how few tools he has at home and he decided to buy a toolbox.
//Develop the code that Derek uses to ask the shop assistant to find him a toolbox with the three tools he needs.
//Follow the instructions below:
//- You need the following classes: Tool, Toolbox, ShopAssistant and ToolShopApplication.
//- Reuse the Tool from exercise 3 (donâ€™t copy it, reuse the existing one from the package where it already is).
//- A Toolbox has a color and a list of Tool. Its constructor only asks for the color. Make sure its tools are initialized with an empty collection. It also has the method add to add a Tool to its list and the method getTools that returns the list. It also has the getColor method.
//- A ShopAssistant has no attributes. It has the findToolbox method that receives a list of String representing the names of the tools the customer asks for and returns a Toolbox. In order to create a Toolbox it creates one tool per tool requested adding them to the Toolbox then it returns it.
//- In the ToolShopApplication class main method, create a list of String with three tool names inside, create a ShopAssistant and use it to find a red Toolbox with those three tools inside.
